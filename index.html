            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am 24 years old. I attended Aston University in 2017 to study Chemistry. However, due to personal reasons, I had to leave during my second year of study. In November 2019, I started a part time job working for Tesco as a customer assistant. I began to work long hours. Thankfully, I was kept on after the Christmas period. I quickly became fascinated by the whole business and analytical side of retail. During the insanely hectic COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, I began to take a greater responsibility in-store, becoming a supervisor and then by the start of 2021, I officially completed my training and got signed on as a Shift Leader. Now, for the last two years, I have been a Shift Leader in 4 different stores, all varying in required skillsets, but as I am versatile, this was never a problem. At one point, I had the intention to progress as far as I can and potentially one day become a Store Manager, howvever, just in the three and a half years I have been in Tesco, there have been too many job cuts in the company, which has led to my own progress to stall. I am too ambitious and motivated for my current situation and I think that I can get more out of my potential than what I currently am. This is why I am now looking to transition into the technology industry. Tech is the present and also the future. I believe that I have the talent and drive to be successful in a tech career.

            <p>
                I have visited 12 countries, including Norway, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates. I love the thrill of visiting and exploring new places. Travelling also allows me to take many pictures, which I also enjoy doing. I love photography, especially taking pictures of the landscape. Getting that perfect picture is a great feeling. I plan on visiting many more countries in the future. I am also a huge sports fan. I watch a variety of sports including: Football, Cricket, F1, American Football and various others. My love of sports and competition has always made me very competitive in my everyday life, whether it is to do with work or any given activity. My favourite colour is orange. I am an avid Marvel Cinematic Universe fan, having watched every single movie in chronological order and conitinue to do so.
