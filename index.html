            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am 24 years old. I attended Aston University in 2017 to study Chemistry. However, due to personal reasons, I had to leave during my second year of study. In November 2019, I started a part time job working for Tesco as a customer assistant. I began to work long hours. Thankfully, I was kept on after the Christmas period. I quickly became fascinated by the whole business and analytical side of retail. During the insanely hectic COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, I began to take a greater responsibility in-store, becoming a supervisor and then by the start of 2021, I officially completed my training and got signed on as a Shift Leader. Now, for the last two years, I have been a Shift Leader in 4 different stores, all varying in required skillsets, but as I am versatile, this was never a problem. At one point, I had the intention to progress as far as I can and potentially one day become a Store Manager, howvever, just in the three and a half years I have been in Tesco, there have been too many job cuts in the company, which has led to my own progress to stall. I am too ambitious and motivated for my current situation and I think that I can get more out of my potential than what I currently am. This is why I am now looking to transition into the technology industry. Tech is the present and also the future. I believe that I have the talent and drive to be successful in a tech career.
